          <br />
          I am Mile Karovski, retrained UX/UI Designer. I have a Bachelor's
          degree in Music and 12 years of experience as a professional stage
          musician, composer and mentor. I have completed a number of projects
          with various teams and won several awards in international
          competitions. After 12 years in the music industry I need a change and
          have a desire to find a more secure and creative outlet for myself.
          <br />
          <br />
          My experience with music helps me understand the processes of a UX/UI
          design. In fact, I've found that the processes are the same: We have
          deadlines, project understanding, research, teamwork (sometimes
          individual), target audience, we want to convey a clear message or
          solve a specific problem, prototyping, testing, etc.
          <br />
          All of these processes are familiar to me and help me solve design
          projects. My 8 years of experience as a mentor helps me a lot and
          gives me the opportunity to develop deep empathy. I can easily and
          quickly put myself in the shoes of the user.
          <br />
          <br />
          I see myself as someone who never stops learning. I am a big picture
          thinker, obsessed with working out the details. I am personable and an
          energetic collaborator. Ambitious, diplomatic & adaptable to the task
          at hand. I am always trying to grow and learn something new. I am a
          team player, [working with different teams on different projects as a
          musician has made me a great team player]. I have a deep sense of
          empathy. I'm willing to experiment and I'm not afraid to be wrong.
          <br />
          <br />
          I believe that equal access to information and technology has the
          power to create a more just and inclusive world.
